## Advanced Grammar

### Passive Voice vs Active Voice
- **Function**: Change the focus of a sentence from the subject (active) to the object (passive).
- **Active Voice**: The subject performs the action.
  1. She wrote the letter.
  2. They are building a house.
  3. We will complete the project.
- **Passive Voice**: The subject receives the action.
  1. The letter was written by her.
  2. A house is being built by them.
  3. The project will be completed by us.
- **Usage Example**:
  - Active: The chef prepared the meal.
  - Passive: The meal was prepared by the chef.

### When to Use Passive Voice
- When the action is more important than who does it.
  1. English is spoken worldwide.
  2. The building was constructed in 1920.
- When the subject is unknown or unimportant.
  1. My car was stolen last night.
  2. Mistakes were made in the report.
- In formal or scientific writing.
  1. The experiment was conducted carefully.
  2. The results were analyzed thoroughly.

### Reported Speech (Indirect Speech)
- **Function**: Report what someone said without using their exact words.
- **Direct Speech**: Using exact words with quotation marks.
  1. She said, "I am happy."
  2. He asked, "Where are you going?"
  3. They said, "We will come tomorrow."
- **Reported Speech**: Reporting without quotation marks.
  1. She said that she was happy.
  2. He asked where I was going.
  3. They said that they would come the next day.

### Changes in Reported Speech
- **Pronouns**: Change according to the speaker.
  1. "I am tired" → He said he was tired.
- **Tense**: Usually moves one step back in time.
  1. Present → Past: "I work" → He said he worked.
  2. Past → Past Perfect: "I worked" → He said he had worked.
  3. Will → Would: "I will go" → He said he would go.
- **Time expressions**: Change to match the reporting time.
  1. today → that day
  2. tomorrow → the next day
  3. yesterday → the day before

### Common Mistakes
- **Fewer vs Less**: Use "fewer" with countable nouns, "less" with uncountable.
  1. Fewer people (countable)
  2. Less water (uncountable)
  3. Fewer books, less time
- **Then vs Than**: "Then" for time, "than" for comparisons.
  1. First we eat, then we go. (time)
  2. She is taller than me. (comparison)
- **There vs Their vs They're**: Different meanings and uses.
  1. There is a book on the table. (location/existence)
  2. Their house is big. (possessive)
  3. They're going home. (they are)
- **To vs Too vs Two**: Different meanings and uses.
  1. I want to go. (infinitive/direction)
  2. It's too hot. (excessive)
  3. I have two cats. (number)

### Usage Tips
- Use passive voice when the action or result is more important than the doer.
- In reported speech, remember to change pronouns, tenses, and time expressions appropriately.
- Practice common mistake pairs by creating example sentences for each usage.
