### additional class insights:

3. **concise**: brief and efficient in communication
4. **nod and smile**: expression for when people pretend to understand but don't
5. **distinction**: difference between things

#### pronunciation practice needed:
1. **colleagues**: stretch the 'ee' sound - /ˈkɒliːɡz/

#### communication strengths identified:
1. Good ability to explain technical concepts (front-end, UX/UI)
2. Comfortable discussing weather and personal preferences
3. Can engage in small talk naturally

#### areas for improvement:

2. **preposition usage**: "explain to them" vs "explain for them"
3. **article usage**: "the teacher" instead of "teacher"
4. **sentence structure**: making complex ideas clearer

#### next steps:
