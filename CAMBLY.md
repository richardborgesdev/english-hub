#### Pronunciation practice needed:
1. **colleagues**: stretch the 'ee' sound - /ˈkɒliːɡz/
2. **throughout**: sustain the 'th' sound longer - /θruːˈaʊt/

#### Communication strengths identified:
1. Good ability to explain technical concepts (front-end, UX/UI)
2. Comfortable discussing weather and personal preferences
3. Can engage in small talk naturally

#### Areas for improvement:
1. **descriptive vocabulary**: need more adjectives and adverbs to express feelings precisely
2. **preposition usage**: "explain to them" vs "explain for them"
3. **article usage**: "the teacher" instead of "teacher"
4. **sentence structure**: making complex ideas clearer

#### Next steps:
1. Complete A2 grammar course (1 lesson per week)
2. Practice describing pictures using Engoo materials
3. Continue with "English for Software Developers" course
4. Start writing practice (diary or notes about daily experiences)
5. Focus on professional introduction skills

#### Teacher's assessment:
- Level: Above A2, working toward B1
- Main weakness: lack of descriptive vocabulary and idioms
- Strength: technical vocabulary and willingness to communicate
- Recommendation: balance grammar study with speaking practice
